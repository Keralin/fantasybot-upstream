"""Regression: match_name must not silently pick one of several ambiguous matches.

The token fallback accepted the FIRST index entry whose key contained all the
nickname tokens. With a short/common nickname ("Pedro", "Álvarez") several players
match and it returned an arbitrary one — a false positive that SANITY_MAX_DIFF in
flip.py then has to paper over. An ambiguous token match must resolve to None; the
real fix (an ID crosswalk) builds on top of a matcher that no longer lies.
